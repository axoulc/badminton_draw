```

## Key Features

### Tournament Modes
- **Singles (1v1):** 1 player per team, min 2 players
- **Doubles (2v2):** 2 players per team, min 4 players

### Scoring System
- **Winner:** +2 points
- **Loser:** +1 point (participation)
- **Rankings:** Sorted by points â†’ win rate â†’ total wins â†’ name

### Data Models
```dart
Player {
  id: String
  name: String
  wins: int
  losses: int
  points: int
  // Computed: totalMatches, winRate
}

Match {
  id: String
  team1: List<Player>
  team2: List<Player>
  winnerId: String?  // null = not played
  // Computed: isCompleted, team1Won, team2Won
}

Round {
  id: String
  number: int
  matches: List<Match>
  // Computed: isCompleted, completedCount, completionRate
}

Tournament {
  id: String
  name: String
  mode: TournamentMode  // singles | doubles
  status: TournamentStatus  // setup | active | completed
  players: List<Player>
  rounds: List<Round>
}
```

## State Management (Provider)

```dart
// Access in widget
final provider = context.watch<TournamentProvider>();
final tournament = provider.tournament;

// Methods
await provider.createTournament(name: 'My Tournament', mode: TournamentMode.doubles);
await provider.addPlayer('John Doe');
await provider.startTournament();
await provider.generateRound();
await provider.recordMatchResult(roundId: '...', matchId: '...', winnerId: 'team1');
```

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. **Update Model** (if needed) in `lib/models/`
2. **Add Service Logic** in `lib/services/`
3. **Update Provider** in `lib/providers/tournament_provider.dart`
4. **Create/Update Screen** in `lib/screens/`
5. **Test manually** with hot reload

### Debugging
1. Use `print()` or `debugPrint()` for logging
2. Press 'd' in terminal to open DevTools
3. Use breakpoints in VS Code with F5 debug
4. Check Flutter Inspector for widget tree

### Adding Dependencies
1. Add to `pubspec.yaml` under `dependencies:`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Import in Dart files: `import 'package:package_name/file.dart';`

## Testing Checklist

### Setup Phase
- [ ] Create tournament with singles mode
- [ ] Create tournament with doubles mode
- [ ] Add players (valid names)
- [ ] Try duplicate player names (should fail)
- [ ] Try empty player names (should fail)
- [ ] Remove players
- [ ] Start tournament with min players
- [ ] Try start with insufficient players (should fail)

### Active Phase
- [ ] Generate first round
- [ ] View matches in rounds tab
- [ ] Score matches (tap teams)
- [ ] View updated rankings
- [ ] Generate additional rounds
- [ ] Check player stats update correctly

### Rankings
- [ ] Verify top 3 have medals
- [ ] Check sorting (points â†’ win rate â†’ wins)
- [ ] Verify stats (wins, losses, win rate)

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Refresh browser (should reload tournament)
- [ ] Export tournament JSON
- [ ] Create backup
- [ ] Reset tournament
- [ ] Delete tournament

## Performance Tips
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Avoid rebuilding entire widget tree (use `Consumer` wisely)
- Use `ListView.builder` for long lists (already done)
- Profile with DevTools if performance issues arise

## Next Development Steps

### High Priority
1. Add unit tests for services
2. Add widget tests for screens
3. Handle edge cases (odd number of players)
4. Add match history view

### Medium Priority
1. CSV export for rankings
2. Player statistics trends/graphs
3. Tournament templates
4. Custom scoring rules

### Low Priority
1. iOS platform support
2. Desktop platforms
3. Cloud sync
4. Multi-tournament management

## Troubleshooting

### "Waiting for connection from debug service"
- This is normal, wait 10-20 seconds for Chrome to start
- Check if Chrome is installed and in PATH

### "Target of URI doesn't exist" errors
- Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
- Check if file paths are correct

### Hot reload not working
- Try hot restart (press 'R')
- If still broken, stop and restart `flutter run`

### App not updating
- Check if you saved the file
- Press 'r' for hot reload
- Check terminal for compilation errors

### Build failures
- Run `flutter clean`
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Try again
