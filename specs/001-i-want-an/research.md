# Research: Badminton Doubles Tournament Manager

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework Decision
**Decision**: Minimal JavaScript with Material 3 Web Components  
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with frugal development principle (minimal dependencies)
- Material 3 provides built-in modern UI components without custom CSS overhead
- Web Components are native browser standard, reducing framework lock-in
- Sufficient for tournament management workflows without complex state management needs

**Alternatives considered**:
- React/Vue.js: Rejected due to added complexity and build overhead for simple requirements
- Plain HTML/CSS: Rejected due to lack of Material 3 design system integration
- Framework-heavy solutions: Rejected as over-engineering for utility application

### Storage Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Browser localStorage with JSON serialization  
**Rationale**:
- Meets persistence requirement (FR-006) with zero infrastructure
- Suitable for small tournament data (4-20 players max)  
- Offline-capable by default
- No server/database maintenance burden

**Alternatives considered**:
- Backend database: Rejected as unnecessary complexity for local tournament tool
- IndexedDB: Rejected as overkill for simple tournament data structures
- File-based storage: Rejected due to browser security limitations

### Deployment Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Docker container with nginx serving static files  
**Rationale**:
- Meets Docker deployment requirement from user specification
- Simple nginx setup for static file serving
- No runtime dependencies or complex orchestration
- Easy to deploy on any server with Docker support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Node.js server: Rejected as unnecessary for static content
- CDN deployment: Rejected due to Docker requirement
- Complex containerization: Rejected due to frugal development principles

### UI Architecture Decision
**Decision**: Multi-page SPA with tab-based navigation  
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of tournament phases (player mgmt, round generation, scoring, rankings)
- Material 3 tabs provide intuitive navigation patterns
- Each page can focus on single responsibility (FR-001 to FR-010)
- Progressive disclosure of tournament workflow

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single page with sections: Rejected due to information overload
- Multi-page with full page reloads: Rejected due to state loss concerns
- Modal-based workflow: Rejected due to poor mobile experience

## Implementation Approach

### Pairing Algorithm Strategy
**Decision**: Fisher-Yates shuffle with constraints  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures truly random pairings for each round
- Can enforce "no consecutive same partner" rule (FR-002)
- Simple to implement and test
- Handles odd player counts gracefully (FR-007)

### Data Model Strategy
**Decision**: Plain JavaScript objects with JSON persistence  
**Rationale**:
- No ORM overhead for simple data structures
- Easy to debug and modify
- Direct serialization to localStorage
- Matches functional-first principle

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Focus on pairing logic and scoring calculations only  
**Rationale**:
- Critical business logic where bugs would break tournaments
- UI testing via manual scenarios in quickstart.md
- Aligns with pragmatic testing principle
- Minimal test maintenance burden

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Target
**Target**: <500KB total bundle size  
**Approach**: 
- Tree-shake unused Material 3 components
- Avoid large utility libraries
- Inline small dependencies

### Load Time Target  
**Target**: <2s initial load on 3G connection  
**Approach**:
- Lazy load non-critical pages
- Optimize Material 3 component imports
- Simple nginx gzip compression in Docker

## Risk Mitigation

### Browser Compatibility Risk
**Risk**: Material 3 Web Components support  
**Mitigation**: Target modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)  
**Fallback**: Provide clear browser requirements in documentation

### Data Loss Risk  
**Risk**: localStorage data loss on browser clear  
**Mitigation**: Export/import functionality for tournament backup  
**Acceptance**: Small tournaments can be recreated if needed

### Deployment Complexity Risk
**Risk**: Docker setup complexity for end users  
**Mitigation**: Single Dockerfile with comprehensive documentation  
**Fallback**: Provide static file deployment alternative
