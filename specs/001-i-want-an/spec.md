# Feature Specification: Badminton Doubles Tournament Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-an`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want an interface that allows me to create doubles teams for badminton from a list of first names. That is, for each round, to randomly select a pair and also randomly select their opponents. I want a different pair for each round. I also want to be able to indicate at the end of each match which pair won (+2 for the winners and +1 for the losers individually) and when the tournament is over, I want to be able to see each player's individual score to determine a ranking (it would be nice to be able to see this at each round). Finally, I want a place on the interface where I can easily edit the list of first names."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚úì Feature description provided and parsed
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚úì Identified: tournament organizer (actor), random pairing (action), scoring system (data), player management (constraints)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚úì No major ambiguities - requirements are clear from user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚úì Clear user workflows identified for tournament management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚úì Each requirement derived from user needs and testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚úì Players, rounds, matches, tournament state identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚úì No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Keep scope minimal: "Good enough" functional requirements, not perfection

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Frugal principle**: Specify minimum viable requirements, not ideal-state features

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A tournament organizer wants to run a badminton doubles tournament where players are randomly paired into different teams each round, scores are tracked, and final rankings are calculated based on individual performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a list of player names, **When** starting a new round, **Then** the system randomly creates unique pairs and matches them against each other
2. **Given** a completed match, **When** recording the winning pair, **Then** winners get +2 points each and losers get +1 point each
3. **Given** multiple completed rounds, **When** viewing rankings, **Then** players are listed by total score in descending order
4. **Given** an existing player list, **When** editing names, **Then** changes are saved and available for future rounds
5. **Given** any point during the tournament, **When** requesting current standings, **Then** live rankings are displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are odd numbers of players (one player sits out)?
- How does system handle duplicate names in the player list?
- What happens if a match result is recorded incorrectly and needs to be changed?
- How does system prevent the same pairing from occurring in consecutive rounds?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, and remove player names from a master list
- **FR-002**: System MUST randomly generate doubles pairs for each round, ensuring no player is paired with the same partner twice in consecutive rounds
- **FR-003**: System MUST randomly match pairs against each other for each round
- **FR-004**: System MUST track match results with winners receiving +2 points and losers receiving +1 point per individual player
- **FR-005**: System MUST display current player rankings sorted by total score at any time
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist tournament data between rounds and sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle odd numbers of players by having one player sit out each round
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent duplicate player names in the master list
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow starting a new tournament (clearing all scores while keeping player list)
- **FR-010**: System MUST display match pairings clearly before results are recorded

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Player**: Represents a participant with first name and cumulative score across all rounds
- **Round**: Represents a tournament round containing multiple matches with generated pairings
- **Match**: Represents a single doubles match between two pairs with a recorded result
- **Tournament**: Represents the overall tournament state including all players, rounds, and current standings
