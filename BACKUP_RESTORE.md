## Quick Start

### Creating a Backup

1. **During a tournament:**
   - Click the menu button (‚ãÆ) in the top-right corner
   - Select **"Export Backup"**
   - A JSON file will automatically download
   - Filename format: `TournamentName_backup_2025-10-01.json`

### Restoring from a Backup

2. **With an existing tournament:**
   - Click the menu button (‚ãÆ)
   - Select **"Import Backup"**
   - Choose your backup JSON file
   - Confirm to replace current tournament

3. **Without a tournament (fresh start):**
   - On the Setup screen
   - Click **"Import Backup"** button
   - Choose your backup JSON file
   - Tournament will be restored immediately

## What's Included in a Backup

## Backup File Format

  "status": "active",
  "winnerPoints": 2,
  "loserPoints": 1,

    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Alice",
      "wins": 3,
      "losses": 1,
      "points": 7
    }
  ],
  "rounds": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "number": 1,
      "matches": [...]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-01T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Best Practices

### üéØ When to Create Backups

**Before major actions:**
- Before editing match results
- Before changing scoring settings
- Before resetting rounds
- Before deleting players

**Regular backups:**
- After completing each round
- At the end of each day (multi-day tournaments)
- Before closing the browser/app

**Archive backups:**
- When tournament is completed
- For historical records
- For analysis and reporting

### üìÅ Where to Store Backups

**Local storage:**
- Downloads folder (automatically saved here)
- Create a "Tournament Backups" folder
- Name files clearly with date and tournament name

**Cloud storage:**
- Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive
- Automatic sync enabled
- Accessible from multiple devices

**Version control:**
- Keep multiple versions
- Example naming: `Summer2025_Round1.json`, `Summer2025_Round2.json`
- Don't delete old backups too quickly

### üîÑ Backup Workflow

**Daily tournament workflow:**
1. **Start of day:** Import backup from previous session
2. **After each round:** Export backup
3. **Before changes:** Export backup
4. **End of day:** Final backup export

**Weekly tournament workflow:**
1. **Week start:** Create initial backup
2. **After each session:** Export updated backup
3. **Week end:** Archive final backup

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Import Fails: "Invalid backup file format"

**Causes:**
- File is corrupted
- JSON syntax error

**Solutions:**
- Try a different backup file
- Verify file extension is `.json`
- Open file in text editor to check if it's valid JSON

### ‚ùå File Won't Download

## Advanced Usage

### Sharing Tournaments

### Manual Editing

For advanced users, you can manually edit backup JSON files:
