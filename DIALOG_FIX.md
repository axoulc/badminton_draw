# Fix Applied: Material 3 Dialog Opening Issue

## Problem Identified
The `<md-dialog>` components were not opening because the Material 3 Web Components weren't fully initialized/upgraded when we tried to call `.show()` on them.

**Symptoms:**
- Settings dialog wouldn't open when clicking settings button
- Score Match button wouldn't open scoring dialog
- `dialog.open` was `undefined` (dialog not upgraded yet)
- `dialog.hasAttribute('open')` was `true` but dialog not visible

## Root Cause
Material 3 Web Components use custom elements that need to be:
1. **Defined** (registered with `customElements.define()`)
2. **Upgraded** (converted from regular HTML to custom element instances)

We were trying to call `dialog.show()` before step 2 completed.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Helper Method `openMaterialDialog()`
Added to both `BadmintonTournamentApp` and `ScoringPage` classes:

```javascript
async openMaterialDialog(dialog) {
    // Wait for md-dialog custom element to be defined
    if (!customElements.get('md-dialog')) {
        await customElements.whenDefined('md-dialog');
    }
    
    // Give element time to upgrade
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
    
    // Call show() method if available
    if (typeof dialog.show === 'function') {
        dialog.show();
        return true;
    }
    
    // Fallback to setting attributes
    dialog.open = true;
    dialog.setAttribute('open', 'true');
    return true;
}
```

### 2. Updated Dialog Opening Methods
- **`openSettings()`** in `src/app.js` - Now uses `await this.openMaterialDialog(dialog)`
- **`openScoreDialog()`** in `src/pages/scoring/scoring-page.js` - Now uses `await this.openMaterialDialog(dialog)`

### 3. Made Methods Async
Changed both methods from sync to async to support awaiting the dialog initialization:
- `openSettings()` → `async openSettings()`
- `openScoreDialog()` → `async openScoreDialog()`

## Files Modified
1. `/home/axel-fpoc/badminton_draw/src/app.js`
   - Added `openMaterialDialog()` helper method
   - Updated `openSettings()` to use helper
   
2. `/home/axel-fpoc/badminton_draw/src/pages/scoring/scoring-page.js`
   - Added `openMaterialDialog()` helper method
   - Updated `openScoreDialog()` to use helper

## Testing
After these changes:
1. Click settings icon (⚙️) - Dialog should open
2. Go to Scoring tab, click "Score Match" - Dialog should open
3. Console should show:
   ```
   Opening Material dialog: settings-dialog
   Dialog methods: { hasShow: "function", ... }
   ✅ Opening with show() method
   ```

## Why This Works
- **`customElements.whenDefined()`** - Waits for the custom element class to be registered
- **`setTimeout(..., 0)`** - Gives browser a tick to upgrade the element instance
- **Type checking `typeof dialog.show`** - Confirms the element is fully upgraded
- **Async/await pattern** - Ensures proper sequencing of operations

## Additional Notes
This issue was NOT caused by browser caching. It was a timing issue with Material 3 component initialization that happened regardless of cache state.

The same pattern should be applied to ALL dialog opening methods in the application:
- Players page edit/delete dialogs
- Rounds page details dialog  
- Scoring page confirm dialog
- Rankings page player details dialog
