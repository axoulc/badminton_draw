## Data Preserved in Backup

The JSON backup includes complete tournament state:
- ✅ Tournament metadata (id, name, mode, status)
- ✅ Configuration (winnerPoints, loserPoints)
- ✅ All players (id, name, wins, losses, points)
- ✅ All rounds (id, number, matches)
- ✅ All matches (id, teams, winnerId, completion status)
- ✅ Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

## User Experience

### Export Flow
1. User clicks menu → "Export Backup"
2. JSON file automatically downloads
3. Success message shows filename
4. File saved to browser's download folder

### Import Flow
1. User clicks "Import Backup" button
2. Native file picker opens
3. User selects .json file
4. Tournament loads instantly
5. Success message confirms import
6. UI refreshes with restored data

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Safari
- ℹ️ Requires HTML5 FileReader and Blob APIs

## Error Handling

- Invalid JSON format → Clear error message
- Corrupted file → Exception caught, user notified
- File read error → Graceful degradation
- Import during tournament → Overwrites (with menu placement indicating this)

## Security Considerations

- ⚠️ Backups are plain JSON (not encrypted)
- ⚠️ Files can be manually edited (advanced users)
- ⚠️ No sensitive data validation
- ℹ️ Client-side only (no server involved)

## Known Limitations

1. **No automatic backups** - User must manually export
2. **No backup history** - Each export overwrites (user manages files)
3. **No cloud sync** - User must manually upload to cloud storage
4. **No encryption** - Plain text JSON
5. **Web only** - Uses dart:html (Flutter web specific)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Automatic periodic backups
- Backup history/versioning
- Cloud storage integration
- Backup encryption
- Backup comparison/diff tool
- Selective restore (only players/rounds)

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Export tournament with players
2. ✅ Import on fresh setup
3. ✅ Verify all data preserved
4. ✅ Test with completed matches
5. ✅ Test with custom scoring settings
6. ✅ Export during active tournament
7. ✅ Import during active tournament (overwrites)
8. ✅ Test error handling (invalid JSON)

## Backwards Compatibility

- ✅ Existing tournaments unaffected
- ✅ No database migrations needed
- ✅ Uses existing Tournament.toJson()/fromJson() methods
- ✅ Compatible with existing storage system

## Impact on Other Features

- ✅ No conflicts with other features
- ✅ Works alongside existing "Create Backup" (localStorage)
- ✅ Works with JSON player import
- ✅ Works with match editing
- ✅ Works with scoring settings

## Code Quality

- ✅ No compilation errors
- ℹ️ 11 deprecation warnings (dart:html, withOpacity)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ User feedback (snackbars)
- ✅ Context safety (mounted checks)

## Documentation Quality

- ✅ Inline code comments
- ✅ User guide (BACKUP_RESTORE.md)
- ✅ Feature documentation (NEW_FEATURES.md)
- ✅ Technical changelog (this file)
